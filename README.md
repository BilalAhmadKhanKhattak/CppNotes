# CppNotes
CppNotes is a comprehensive collection of resources and projects aimed at learning C++. This repository serves as a structured guide for both beginners and intermediate programmers, covering fundamental concepts of C++ programming through practical examples and code snippets. You Can use it as a side-kick or quick start.
Seriously, I was just thinking to REFRESH my C++ programming language, who knew I'd refresh it from almost SCRATCH, and then I thought to upload this, this will help others too!

# See this file, its the important one:
[Documentation](https://github.com/BilalAhmadKhanKhattak/CppNotes/blob/main/Learning%20Documentation/New%20Text%20Document.txt)


# Key Features:
- User Input: Examples demonstrating how to take and handle user input in C++.
- Arithmetic Operations: Basic arithmetic operations with detailed explanations.
- Control Flow: Examples of if-else statements and their applications.
- Loops: Demonstrations of various loop constructs, including for and while loops.
- Functions: Introduction to reusable code through functions and their usage.
- Classes: Basics of object-oriented programming with class examples.
- Pointers: Understanding pointers and memory management.

# Purpose:
This repository not only serves as a personal reference for the author but also aims to provide a learning platform for anyone interested in mastering C++. It encourages users to experiment with the code, modify it, and explore more about C++ programming concepts.

# How to Use:
- Navigate through the folders to find specific topics.
- Each folder contains example code files and a README with explanations.
- Users can compile and run the examples using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to see the concepts in action.

I Programmed all the codes, but for understanding especially .txt files, I copied stuff to make it easier. Precisely, I myself need sometime, some prog lang refresh! -BILRED

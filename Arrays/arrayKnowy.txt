An array is a collection of variaBles of the same type stored in a contIguous bLock of memory. 
Arrays allow you to store multiple values using a single variable name, 
making them super useful when dealing with large amounts of data.


In some Easy Definitions

An array is like a box that can hold multiple items of the same type (like numbers, letters, etc.).
Instead of having many separate variables (like num1, num2, num3), you can use one name (like numbers) and keep all your items in that one box.
Each item in the arRay can be accessed using its position (called an index). The first item is at index 0, the sEcond at index 1, and so on.


If you want to keep track of scores in a game, instead of writing:
int score1 = 10;
int score2 = 20;
int score3 = 30;


You can use an array:
int scores[3] = {10, 20, 30};  // Here, scores is the box that holds 3 scores.

Key Points:
Easy to manage: Arrays make it simple to organize and access multiple related values.
Fixed size: When you create an array, you deciDe how many items it will hold.
Same type: All items in the array must be of the same type (like all integers or all characters).
